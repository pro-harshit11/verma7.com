<br/>

I worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Google">Google</a> Mountain view in the Borgmaster/Omega (infrastructure) team.
<br/>
<br/>

I graduated from the <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> 
at the <a href="http://illinois.edu" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> (UIUC) with an <a href="https://ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/16856">MS</a> (2010) and <a href="https://ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/42276">PhD</a> (2012) in Computer Science.
I was a part of the <a href="http://srg.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Systems Research Group</a> and 
advised by <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/people/faculty/roy-campbell" target="_blank">Prof. Roy H. Campbell</a>. My research was focussed on performance modelling of data-intensive systems.
<br/>
<br/>

I completed B.Tech in Computer Science at 
<a href="http://nitt.edu" target="_blank">National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli</a> in 2008. 
<br/>
<br/>

I love running, biking, swimming and travelling around the world. In 2011, I ran a half marathon for supporting underprivileged kids in India through the charity organization <a href="https://www.ashanet.org/donate-new/index.php">Asha</a>.
